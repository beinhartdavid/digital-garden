I've started with _____ template and am slowly making changes as I learn more about Gatsby, React, JS, HTML, Git ect ect. 

Some of my first tweaks included changing the title of the site and adding my own picture (which I have not figured out how to rotate) and making a crude component Footer by adjusting the existing options. 

Next on my to-do list is to create a way to mark articles as draft so that I can work on them without the pressure of knowing that they are live.
