I've started with _____ template and am slowly making changes as I learn more about Gatsby, React, JS, HTML, Git ect ect. 

Some of my first tweaks included changing the title of the site and adding my own picture (which I have not figured out how to rotate) and making a crude component Footer by adjusting the existing options. 

Next on my to-do list is to create a way to mark articles as draft so that I can work on them without the pressure of knowing that they are live. 

I found this video to be very helpful in adding a drafts to my posts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg1bom99uGM
One thing I can not figure out is how the slugs are being handled for the pages that are not published. For example http://localhost:8000/draft/ will be a completly blank screen instead of the 404.js page that is included with the gatsby-starter-blog files But if I were to try to go to http://localhost:8000/not-a-real-page/ I would trigger this. I believe this has something to do with how th pages are rendered and need to look at the other files. 

All I have done based on the video, is add filter: { frontmatter: {published: {eq: true}}} to my pageQuery in index.  [link](#Foo)
